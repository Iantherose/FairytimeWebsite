Obviously.”\r\n\r\n“Mia’s gotta lot of ties around this town.”\r\n“Someone coulda pulled a few strings for all we know.”\r\n\r\n“Also, I’m pretty sure Micky lost that chunk of his ear in a fishing accident.”\r\n“Debra told me.”\r\n\r\n“Debra’s a liar and idiot.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, well Debra also knows everything about everyone plus her dad’s a doctor.”\r\n\r\n“So?”\r\n\r\n“So he probably told her about stitching Micky’s ear up or something.”\r\n“I’m gonna have to defer to Occam’s Razor.”\r\n\r\n“Who-”\r\n\r\n“Occam’s Razor is a-”\r\n\r\n“Cares what you think.”\r\n“I know what the truth is cos I got it from the source.”\r\n“Mia herself.”\r\n\r\n“Well technically Micky’s the source cos it’s his ear chunk that’s missing.”\r\n\r\n“Yah, but Mia has it!”\r\n\r\n“Allegedly.”\r\n\r\n\r\nKasmiera stands up.\r\n\r\n“Hey!”\r\n“Sit down!”\r\n\r\n“Huh?”\r\n\r\n“You're seriously not moving cos of some tall-tale, are you?”\r\n\r\n“I mean, lie or not, which it isn't by the way, have you seen Mia?”\r\n“Tall, big, and I heard she went to juvie for stabbing someone.”\r\n“She's not the kinda girl you wanna mess with.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I fell asleep.”\r\n\r\n“Yup.” \r\n“Slept through your first detention.”\r\n\r\n“Oh sorry about that.”\r\n\r\n“It's fine.”\r\n“Better than the constant pestering of Nadine.”\r\n“Looking at her sleeping like that it almost makes me forget how annoying she is awake.”\r\n\r\n“Should I wake her up?”\r\n\r\n“Sigh.”\r\n“I guess so considering I can't just lock her in here.”\r\n\r\nKasmiera taps Dino awake. \r\n\r\n“What…”\r\n“What is it.”\r\n\r\n“Detentions over.”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n“Damn, I thought I could sleep a few minutes longer.”\r\n\r\n“You've got a bed back at your place I'm sure. Now let's get moving.”\r\n\r\nHallway\r\n\r\n“I hate walking through this hallway.”\r\n“It's so creepy.”\r\n\r\n“Yah, I don't get why they don't replace the lights here.”\r\n“The flickering really spooks me out.”\r\n\r\n“It's not that bad.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you'd think that, seeing as how you're the scariest thing here.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you!”\r\n“But if you're really that scared you can always get behind me.”\r\n\r\n“And what would you skinny butt do, huh?”\r\n\r\n“You know what?”\r\n“Forget I said anything.”\r\n“If ghosts attack I'll just help the quiet one and let them take you.”\r\n\r\n“Better that than having to listen to you speak another second.”\r\n\r\n“If only I had a Void of Silence card handy.”\r\n\r\n“Wait, you play FairyFight too?”\r\n\r\n“Yah, with my little brother.”\r\n“He loves that baby crap.”\r\n\r\n“Oh.”\r\n\r\n“...”\r\n“But I guess it's not a bad game.”\r\n“Especially considering I'm a pretty good duelist.”\r\n“What's your best card?”\r\n\r\n“Fairy Dragon Knight.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n“You actually have one of those!”\r\n\r\n“I've got three actually.”\r\n\r\nKasmiera sticks her hand in her pocket.\r\n\r\n“I got another one this morning…”\r\n\"It's somewhere in here.”\r\n“Somewhere…”\r\n\r\n“Um, you good?”\r\n\r\n“I-I can't find it…”\r\n\r\n“You seriously lost a Dragon Fairy Knight Card?”\r\n\r\n“No it has to be here somewhere!” \r\n“Maybe it dropped in the classroom.”\r\n“I gotta go back for it!”\r\n\r\n“And walk through that creepy hallway again?”\r\n“No way.”\r\n\r\n“Please, it's really important.”\r\n\r\n“It's just a card game, Kasmiera.”\r\n“After all, if you really left it in the classroom it'll be there tomorrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“But what if someone comes in and takes it!”\r\n\r\n“Just come in early.”\r\n“That way no one's gonna snag that card before you, alright?”\r\n“Now let's get out of here.”\r\n\r\nSwamp corridor\r\n\r\n“Why does it feel like this corridor is never ending?”\r\n“It feels like we've been walking for ages.”\r\n\r\n“Are we…lost?”\r\n\r\n“It's a hallway! How can we be lost?”\r\n\r\n“Well it sure seems like we are.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe we should turn back.” \r\n“Retrace our steps.”\r\n\r\n“We're walking in a straight line!”\r\n“The stairways gotta close.”\r\n\r\n“You know what, you guys keep going nowhere.”\r\nDino turns around.\r\n“I'm gonna go-”\r\n“back…”\r\n\r\n“Well you do whatever you wanna do.”\r\n“It's not like we could stop you anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Guys….”\r\n“Turn around.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Just turn around.”\r\n\r\nThe girls turn around and find they're in a swamp.\r\n\r\n“W-what?”\r\n\r\n“I'm not hallucinating right?”\r\n“You can see the trees too?”\r\n\r\n“Hard to miss.”\r\n\r\n“Where are we?”\r\n\r\n“Isn't it obvious.”\r\n\r\nThe girls turn around again and see a frog sitting in front of them.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I forgot. Your human eyes are faulty,”\r\n“clouded with falsehoods and wickedness.”\r\n“You need not worry, I will take them out for you.”\r\n\r\nCommercial Break \r\n\r\n“You guys are seeing the giant frog man too, right?”\r\n\r\n“Yup, clear as day.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don't tremble so. I only desire one thing from you.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Your lies!”\r\n“Place them before me and you may cross back to the ‘realm of man’ as your kind calls it.”\r\n\r\n“What are you talking about?”\r\n\r\n“Hmmmm.”\r\n“Must all things be revealed to you?”\r\n“Are your minds so confined?”\r\n“Very well, I will say it plainly.”\r\n“The divine eye of Belial sees two lies given life.”\r\n“It desires them back.”\r\n\r\n“I don't understand?”\r\n“What lies?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say!”\r\n“Lies from the lips of liars are sweet as pomegranate seeds”\r\n“but they rot when spoken by witnesses.” \r\n“But if you will not do me the kindness of returning these lies to me.”\r\n\r\nThe frog stands on its hind legs.\r\n\r\n“I will take them!”",

Dead serious. \n<<ezra>>Don't say that word to me!\n<<unknown>>You need to understand the gravity of our situation.\nYou're a failure through no fault of your own, Ezra. \nWhen you and I found out it's sickness was spreading across the world we made it comfortable. \n<<unknown>>We nurtured it to a state of placidity. \nYou kept it sane. \nI found the blood that kept it from declining back to it's malicious state. \nWe achieved serendipity.\nBut come on, we both knew it wouldn't last right?\n<<ezra>>The Ichor!\nYou have some left, right? there must be some left. \n<<unknown>>No Ezra. There's nothing left. It's been gone for a century or so at this point. \n<<unknown>>But you knew that already.\n<<ezra>>Screw this, redirect me to A0.23. \n<<unknown>>She's gone. \n<<ezra>>Alright, then Z.67.\n<<unknown>>Gone.\n<<ezra>>A0.65, .22, SU.23-\n<<unknown>>It's just me.\n<<ezra>>I don't believe that. \n<<unknown>>What? You think I want to be here trying to beat the truth into your thick head?\nDo you know how much shit I've had to deal with over the last few?\n<<unknown>>You know I had to put Dan away, right?\n<<ezra>>B.96? How about him?\n<<unknown>>The nurse there told me that I was sending him to a better future. That one day we'd see each other again in a new world.\n<<ezra>>G0.65...\n<<unknown>>And you know what I did? I slapped her. \nIt took 2 other somnologists to prevent me from beating the shit out of her. \nThen I cried alone in our empty apartment.\n<<ezra>>O.91...Redirect me to Tash. \n<<unknown>>But you don't care...do you? \nYou couldn't even offer your condolences.\n<<ezra>>No! Stop calling it that!\nHe's fine, Nora. He's being preserved and in a few years he'll be up and running again. That's why the work we do is so important. \n<<unknown>>You sound just like the bloody nurse. \nI should sock you just for saying that. \nBut its been over 4 centuries since it happened. \nAnd I'm finally at peace with it.\n<<ezra>>I don't have time for this. Where is everyone?\n<<unknown>>Some chose or were forced to sleep, some drifted off the grid. I can't even tell you where a single person from division C is. \nThe point being they've been gone for eons.\nIt's been just us for the last few centuries. \n<<ezra>>No... \n<<unknown>>Are you finally getting it? \nIs it sinking in?\nIt's over.\nIt's been over for a while now. Everyone pack up, turned off the lights and left.\nThe labs in District5 are desolate. \nThe sick have only gotten sicker and even sleep isn't soothing their pain anymore.\nAnd now you're telling me that the thing you've huddled up with is breaking too?\nI'm reading the signs, Ezra. We've lost. \nWe've done a hell of a job holding back the inevitable. \nBut it's in the name, isn't it?\n<<ezra>>G2.02. She of all people must still be around, right? She was in Asparia? She was making promising strides-\n<<unknown>>You mean well. At least, I hope you do.\nBut I'm not in a place where I want to be having this conversation.\nIn fact, this is probably the last time I'll ever use this phone again. \n<<ezra>>Don't say that.\n<<unknown>>I'm tired, Ezra.\nI don't understand how you're not but I am. \nI've spent so many lifetimes chasing this dream; so much so I cant remember who I was before this. \nI found paintings over at my brother's place once and asked if he took up the hobby. \nHe said they were mine. \nThe only way either of us even knew that was because some variant of my signature was scribbled on the corner. \nI can't give everything to this dream. \nI can't give another few 100 years to brainstorming solutions, find one that \"just might work\", break the bodies of those to desperate to refuse\nThen performing an autopsy on the remains as we say, \"We were so close this time! Maybe in another few year we'll finally be tangible!\". \nIt's too much.\nIt's all too much. \nI want to forget that person entirely. Like I forgot the painter, or writer or martial artist. \nI want my thoughts to be so far removed from her's that we're two different people entirely. \n<<ezra>>The research you were-\n<<unknown>>I burnt it.\nIt's gone. \nI looked through years of notes archived to the t. I really did try, Ezra. But I'm not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel anymore.\nWe were doomed from the start. \n<<ezra>>How could you be so selfish?\n<<ezra>>We're so close to an endless future and you throw everything away to chase some stupid dream? Because you're tired?\nYou think I don't hate the constant string of failure after failure?\n<<ezra>>You think I hadn't thought of that too. \n<<ezra>>Leaving this fucking place, trying to salvage what's left of my life, going to sleep?\n<<unknown>>Then why don't you?\n<<ezra>>Because it seems like I'm the only one who know I have a responsibility to this world and it's people \n<<ezra>>and that somewhere in the universe there's a cure to this sickness, as there was for polio, cancer, briditis.\n<<ezra>>That's why I've held on for so long. \nWe've come to far to throw in the towel and quit. You took an oath dammit! \n<<unknown>>That's not it. \n<<ezra>>Really? Then tell me, what's the reason? Since you're at the peak of enlightment? What my problem?\n<<unknown>>I won't do that. That's something for you to figure out. \n<<ezra>>Jesus Christ, when did you become so cryptic?\nIs this a bit to piss me off or are you finally losing it?\n<<unknown>>I wonder how the bright, optimistic man I met all those eons ago would have felt about you now?\nA bitter shell of what he once was clambering to the only dream he's ever had. \nKnowing deep down no amount of grabbing and pulling and grasping will ever make it tangible. \nThat the human soul and all its constructs will remain obscure to him for what's left of his days. \n<<ezra>>Fuck you. \n<<unknown>>Maybe he'd sympathize. See that deep down these outburst are nothing more than a wounded animals cry as it lies limp in the forest,\nbleating out to anyone that might hear it, wanting for the only thing it knows will cure it's pain.\n<<ezra>>Shut up!\n<<unknown>>Deep down, you know the truth. \nYou want to die just as much as I do. \n<<ezra>>You're a fucking coward. \n<<ezra>>You hear me? You're a fucking coward! Fuck you!",

Sleeper, I mean.\n<<noone>>The bird raised it's needle out of the skin and stares up at them. \n<<her>>Because...that is all I've known you as. \nHer, the creeper. Everywhere all at once.\nClinging to all things. \nweighing them down like fruit in autumn.\nMe, the reaper. ending the things that are to broken to continue going on. \nRendering them null. \nAnd you, the sleeper. Dulling the pain the comes with ending. \nSinging to them sweetly till they forget sorrow and suffering. \nThat is who we are together. \n<<ambros>>I don't remember any of that.\n<<her>>I am replenished now. \nI will lead you the rest of the way. \n<<noone>>The bird jumps out of their hands and scurries along in the darkness. \nThey walked for a long time. \nAmbrose feet growing ever weary as they marched onwards. \nBut just as Ambrose was about to collapse within the darkness and sleep on the cold, stone floor...\nThere was a light in the distance. \nA pale color illuminated the hallway.\nAnd even more than that...\nthere was a voice. \nIt was barely audible. \nIt was hard to make out any words. \nBut...it was\n<<ambros>>Ezra? \n<<her>>Be silent. Walk slowly towards the light. \n<<noone>>Ambrose bit their tongue and nodded shuffling ever so slightly towards the light. \nSoon enough they were able to see what it was.\n<<doorRed>>\nA little room with a glass door slightly ajar. \nThe words became clearer too. \nIt was Ezra. \nHe was in another one of those booths. Phone pressed to his ear. \nWho was it he was speaking to?\nThe same woman from before?\n<<her>>Listen...\n...\n..\n.\n<<ezra1>>They're everywhere. \nI've found as many as I could but they keep...multiplying. \nI know...I'm the last person you want to hear from right now but I need you. \nEverything's falling apart here. \n...\n..\n.\n<<ezra1>>I can't go back there. I don't know what to say to them. \nI'm not sure I can keep lying to them. \nI don't have it in me anymore. \n<<unknown>>You're tired...aren't you. \n<<ezra1>>Don't say it like that. \n<<unknown>>What do you mean?\n<<ezra1>>I'm not an idiot. I know what you mean when you use that word. \nIt...it;s not the same way you are. \nI just need some more time. \n<<unknown>>You're no closer to find a cure for decay than you were all those years ago when we first started this project. \nNothing's changed since then. You've-\n<<ezra1>>They're in a stable condition, aren't they? \nThey're better. \n<<unknown>>They're?\n...\n..\n.\nI wanted to ask you this when we last talked. \nIt's been bugging me. \nI've spent years thinking about it actually. \n...\nYou're not attached to that thing...are you? \n...\n..\n.\n<<ezra1>>They aren't a thing. They're a patient, just like all the others. \n<<unknown>>You know that's not true. \nThat things the reason we started this whole damn project in the first place. \nIt's not a person, Ez. It's the devil!\nIt's death incarnate!\n<<noone>>Ambros clambers back. \nA shudder runs down their spine as the hold a hand over their mouth. \n<<unknown>>You know this. Don't you?\nTell me you know this. \n<<ezra1>>I know...\n<<unknown>>I hope you do. \nI'm not trying to make you feel bad. I just need to know that you know this-\n<<ezra1>>I do! Okay. Now can you just get on with it!\nWhat do I need to do to keep this whole damn project from falling apart. \n<<unknown>>Come on. You and I both know what I'm about to say, right? \nIf you were Dallas or Kian I'd by this whole blockhead shit. \nBut that's not who yo are, is it? \nYou've alread called me four times and I told yah the same thing.\nYou've only got two options here.\n<<ezra1>>No...there has to be another way.\n<<unknown>>There isn't.\nFind a new vessel or \ngive up like everyone else did. \nThat's it. \n<<ezra1>>Where would I even get a new vessel?\n<<unknown>>Go down to Quarter 9. They've been breeding some birds for a while now. \nUse one of those. \nAnd this time...keep it in a cage.\nNot that little condo you've built.\n<<ezra1>>You know just as well as I do that keeping them in a clean, cosy environment produced better results that what they were doing before.\nLess outburst, less prone to illness. \nAll that prevented the sickness from spreading further out of the complex.\nWe can't go back to what those occultists were doing. \n<<unknown>>They kept death at bay for eons. \nWe haven't even achieved half of that. \nAnd I'm not suggesting just any run of the mill cage. \nI sent you the plans didn't I? \nWhat do you think?\n<<ezra1>>It's...it's restrictive or motion. If we put anything in there it's bound to be panicked. \nPanic isn't the reaction we want. \n<<unknown>>You didn't read it in full, did you?\nGo over to page four. \n...\n..\n.\nDo you see that? \nThe vibrations paired with the frequency will induce a comatose state. \nThe figures may have to be adjusted depending on the size and species of the new vessel but outside of that it's a good holding place till we come up with a final solution. \nWe just gotta paint the inner walls white and that's it. \nYou like?\n<<ezra1>>I thought you said we weren't interested in trying to help and now you're drawing up plans? \n<<unknown>>It's damned if you do damned if you don't with you, isn't it?\nIt's been what? Like a century and a half since we last spoke!?\nI'm allowed to change my mind about things. \nAs are you.\nYou should be thanking me now. \nI've found a way to prolong our existence a little longer. \nThat's what you wanted...isn't it?\n<<ezra1>>I-I....\nI have to think about it, okay.\n<<noone>>Ambrose pulls away from the glass. A tear runs down their cheek.\n<<unknown>>Remember who we're doing this for.\nThis is bigger than you, me or the subject.\nWe've conquered death...\nNow we must conquer decay. \n<<her>>Sleeper, we need to go....\n<<noone>>The bird nudges at them by the stay still, staring through the window. \nUnable to move. \n<<ezra1>>You've given me a lot to think about. \nI'll get back to you as soon as I can, alright...\n<<her>>Sleeper, now!\nWe need to go now!\n<<noone>>As the words are spoken Ambrose feels something drip on their shoulder. \nIt runs down the length of their arm. \nA viscous fluid...\nAmbrose looks behind them.\n<<monster>>\n!!!\nThey scream.\nThe red thing inches forward as Ambrose pulls themselves off the ground and scampers away into the darkness. \n<<doorRed2>>\nThere were more of them surrounding the door. \nWhere did they come from?\nYet, that didn't scare them nearly as much as the next thing they heard. \nThe shuffle of footsteps.\nThe click of the latch on the door. \nAnd his voice breaking the silence. \n<<ezra1>>Ambrose...\nIs that you?\nThey wouldn't make the same mistake. \nNot this time.\n...\n..\n.\nAmbrose run away.",

Ambros waited on the sofa for what felt like ages. Ezra did not emerge. \nAs Ambros fell asleep on the couch the soft padding of footsteps had them stir slightly.\nNot enough to break their slumber but enough that they felt their skin prickle. \nA flutter of goosebumps clustered under Ambrose's clothes as they felt a shadow obscure the white light filtering through\nbright windows. \nSome dread captured them and they sprung from their peaceful position. \n<<ambros>>Oh!\n<<ezra>>What's wrong?\n<<ambros>>You scared me for a second.

I guess you'll just have to suck it up and stop being a scaredy cat. \n<<ambros>>Or you could stop creeping around and invest in quieter shoes. \n<<ezra>>ha!\n<<ambros>>What's so funny?\n<<ezra>>Nothing, I was just thinking about the first time we met.\nRemember how you threw that shoe at me when I tried to give you food but the shoe didn't even make it past the end of the bed?\n<<ambros>>What about it? Are you looking for round 2 or something. \n<<ezra>>I don't know. I never would've thought that we'd be so close back then. \nYou hated me I think. \nAnd now look at us? Living in the same house and you've only threatened me once today. \nI think that's progress. \n<<ambros>>The things you get nostalgic over. \n<<noone>>Ambrose looks up at the ceiling and the little lights that sparkled above them.\n<<ambros>>To be honest I don't remember much of any of that. \nI guess I was so sick back then that most of those days were nothing more than a blur. \n<<ezra>>Yah, I suppose so. \n<<ambros>>But, I don't think I hated you.\nI don't remember the events but the feelings are still vivid to me. \nI felt trapped I think. Maybe because of my body or this illness. Or something...\nI was probably just lashing out, I'm sorry-\n<<ezra>>You don't ever need to apologize to me, Ambrose. \nAfter all, it's not like the shoe even hit me. \nNone of it was your fault. \n<<ambros>>Okay. \n<<noone>>The room darkens as the world slowly drifts into night. \nThe pair lie on the couch as a weariness takes hold of them. \n<<ambros>>You know, you can scoop me up and take me to my room now if you like?\n<<ezra>>Yah, it's more of a romantic gesture when you don't ask for it. Just let it happen. \n<<ambros>>You may never get an opportunity like this again.\nI'm very good about going to my room when I tired so you might as well do it now. \nScoop me!\n<<ezra>>Alright, alright. let's go. \n<<noone>>Ezra stands up then hoist Ambrose over his shoulder with both arms. \n<<ambros>>This isn't remotely what I had in mind. \n<<ezra>>You're getting a free ride to your room Ambrose, don't be picky about the mode of transport. \nThey make their way up the stares and into Ambrose's bedroom. \nThen the door is shut behind them.",

What's wrong? \nYour hand...\n\n<<ezra>>You're such a clutz sometimes. \nHow'd you manage to break something like that? \n<<ambros>>It just fell out of nowhere. It falls all the time but I guess it wasn't strong enough this time.\n...\n<<ezra>>Ambrose?\nAmbrose, are you alright?\n<<ambros>>What does that mean? \n<<ezra>>What?\n...\n<<ambros>>Never mind. \n<<ezra>>There, your hands all patched up. I'm going to clean up the owl.\n<<ambros>>Okay.\nHey, would you like me to get a new one? There's plenty in stock so I could get one that's exactly the same as the last one. \n<<ambros>>No.\nIt's gone now.\n<<ezra>>I could always patch it up with some glue if you feel bad about replacing it.\n<<ambros>>It's fine, Ezra. We should let it rest. \n...\n<<ezra>>It's a shame. You really liked that little guy.\n<<noone>>It was an uneventful day. \nOne that played out like the millions of other days before that one. \nThey talked together, laughed together and watched as time inevitably stole another bright day. \nThen came the golden day. with it's shimmering light that slumped itself upon everything like some fine gloss. \nAnd with this, came the desire to sleep once again. \nSo, the two parted and Ambrose returned to his chamber\nand fell asleep. \n\nSomething shuffled in the sheets.\nIt was small enough that Ambrose could cup the thing in their hands if they wanted to. \nBut they don't.\nInstead, they clamber back, taken by the little moving thing. \nA hand reaches for the door knob turning it slightly but before they can the sheet falls off revealing the thing. \nIt's fluffy feathers. It's big eyes. It's tiny, needle beak. \nIt was a bird of some sort. A little bird the color of Ambrose's wound. \nA beautiful shade of it.\nThere's some resistance now. \nSomething tugs Ambrose towards the door.\nBut the big, black eyes of the bird pulled ambrose towards it. \n\nIt chirps. \nA pretty little chirp. \nHow can anyone be afraid of such a thing?\nTrembling fingers drift towards the thing. \nIt trots forward speedily till it's little legs are in Ambrose's hand. \n<<ambros>>You're not so bad, are you? \n<<noone>>A second hand rises from they're side and begins to stroke the thing. \n<<ambros>>What sort of bird are you? A swan chick? or...\n...\nThe other bird?\nYou're nothing like that other bird though.\n<<noone>>It jumps out of their hand and waddles towards the pillow.\nIt lowers it's head till it's nothing more than a fluffy ball and it's black eyes close. \n<<ambros>>I'm tired too.\nI guess you can sleep here with me. \nMy allergies don't seem to be flaring up anyway so there shouldn't be a problem.\nGoodnight. \n...\n..\n.\n<<her>>Goodnight.",

I'm still learning a tonne about birds.\n<<ezra>>...\n<<ambros>>You'd probably be able to help with that, right?\nHey, why aren't you-\n<<noone>>It's a swift motion.\nOne moment Ezra was in front of Ambrose and the next moment he'd lunged forward towards the bird and scooped it in his hand. \nHigh pitched screams penetrated the silence and the little thing chirped out, afraid. \n<<ambros>>What are you doing!?!\n<<ezra>>I'm sorry I didn't believe you, Ambrose. But I have to get rid of this thing.\nIt isn't safe. \n<<ambros>>What do you mean? It's been here for a few days and I've been fine!\nNo flare ups or anything.\nShe won't hurt me. \nNow let go of her.\n<<ezra>>It's more complex than that. I have to get rid of it. \n<<noone>>Ezra turns to leave the room as the bird stares out at Ambrose. \nIt's eyes round with fear and it chirps frantically. \n<<ambros>>Stop it! Y-you're hurting her!\n<<ezra>>I'll release it back into the wild where-\n<<noone>>But before he could complete that statement Ambrose clung to Ezra's balled fist as he struggled to unravel his fingers.\n<<ambros>>I said let go! \n<<ezra>>This is for your own good, Ambros...\n<<ambros>>Why is it always you that gets to decide that!\nWhy can't I decide anything for myself!\n<<ezra>>Now's not the time for this!\n<<ambros>>Let go! You're hurting her!\n<<ezra>>You've already got your swans! You don't need another bird in here. \n<<ambros>>Give her back!\n<<ezra>>Enough!\n<<noone>>With a single swing Ambrose fell to the floor and the bird flew in another direction. \nIt hits the wall and plops onto the ground. \nThen it stays there...still...\nAmbros scurries towards it quickly picking the little creature IN his hands. \n<<ezra>>Oh my god, I didn't mean to hit you like that...\nA-are you okay?\n<<ambros>>You-you broke it...\n<<ezra>>...\n<<ambros>>It won't move anymore...\n<<ezra>>I'm so sorry, that wasn't what I wanted to do. \nI didn't want to kill it-\n<<noone>>His mouth snaps shut as his eyes widen.\n<<ambros>>K-k-ki\nKill? \n<<noone>>Beads of something formed from the corners of their mouth. \nIt dripped down their chin and dripped across the white garments they wore. \n<<ambros>>What does that mean?\n<<noone>>The bird sprung up and sprinted out of the door.

A smog rises from it's roof into the sky. \nHe waits. \nHe waits. \nHe waits. \nHe waits.\nHe waits. \nHe waits.\nHe watches as the flames dwindle away. \nHe has done his work. \nHe is ready to go back to the apartment when-\n\nIt wanders past him!\nThis flurry of color skids past him towards the wooded path. \nThat little fuck.\nHe pounces. \nFaster than a whip he's already at it's feet. \nBut it pivots out of the way towards a phone booth. \nIt foolishly runs in. \nIt jams itself into the corner as he swings the door open and stares down at the thing. \nIt's eyes are big and black and pleading. \nIt chirps. \n<<ezra>>What? \nYou think your little performance is going to move me, huh?\nI know exactly what you are. \n...\n<<her>>Try as you might but I've already won. \nYour game is done. \n<<noone>>He's taken aback. He din't expect it to be so brazen. \nThis is only for a second though. \nHe's booted foot rises.\n<<her>>You've lost, Ezra. \n<<her>>...\n<<noone>>His boot crunches against the little creature. It's blood splatters against the glass. \nIt makes no sound. \n...\nThey're sobs where quiet but still audible. \nAmbrose clung to their pillow as tears stained the sheets underneath them.\nThe stains from earlier where gone washed off the walls and the floors. \nAll the remnant of their little friend were gone. \nAll Ambrose could do was grieve. \nThen something chirped.\nA high pitched happy chirp.\nAmbrose rises!\n<<ambros>>Little bird! \noh...\nLittle bird.\n<<noone>>He whispers this time. \n<<ambros>>I thought you were gone. \nI guess you're stronger than you look. \n<<noone>>It perches up towards they're wrist as it buries it's little beak into the skin.\n<<ambros>>You must be starving after all this commotion. \nIt's okay, take as much as you need. \nI won't stop you. \n<<noone>>There's a shuffle in the corner of the room.\nAmbrose peers over. \n<<ambros>>Oh! You have friends. \nThat's a lot of birds. \n<<noone>>They all wriggle their way onto the bed as ambrose draws back both his sleeves and collapses into the sheets.\n<<ambros>>I didn't know there where so many of you. \nI guess you must all be hungry then.\n<<noone>>The needles slip into the skin as more of Ambrose is drawn out of them and into the birds. \n<<ambros>>Go ahead, take as much as you want. \nMaybe then...\nI'll finally get a good night's rest.",

You know that? \nAfter everything we've been through you're just going to leave? \nYou're not even gonna say why? \n<<ezra>>...\n..\n.\n<<ambros>>Fuck you! \nYou stupid piece of shit, fuck you! \nFuck you! \nFuck You!\nFuck YOU!\n<<noone>>The door stayed intact, despite how much Ambrose hammer against him. \nAmbrose looks down at their hand. \nThe skin on their knuckles was frayed from all the knocking.\nBits on that color peaked out from under the flesh. \nThey shuffled away\nwalking towards the only place they could find some kind of peace. \n<<hideAmbrose>>\n...\n..\n.\n<<swanroom1>>\nThe swans drifted on the water in a hypnotic way. \nThe circled one another in a perpetual state of bliss. \nAt least it appeared so from the outside. \nWhat Ambrose would give to be one of those swans. \nWings broad enough to encompass the whole world. \nFeathers that trace the stars as they pass by. \nA mind so void of anything Ambrose would consider meaningful. \nJust thoughts of sleeping, eating, living. \nA loathsome thing it was. \nThat they were born human instead of a swan. \nThey pulled down their sleeves and traced the little dots on their arms. \nDid those birds abandon them too-\nJust then he felt something soft against his ankle and looked down. \n<<ambros>>You're...you're still here.\n<<showHer>>\n<<noone>>Ambros bent down and picked up the little creature. \nThey stroked it;s little head and the corners of their mouth raised slightly. \n<<ambros>>I thought you'd all gone off too?\n<<noone>>...\n<<ambros>>You know...I think Ezra's left me here. \nI think he's gone. \nJust like that without saying a word.\nWhat do you make of that? \n<<noone>>...\n<<ambros>>You think that sucks too, don't you? \n...\n..\n.\nI just don't get any of this...that conversation he was having about me.\nThe way he left after bringing me back here. \nI thought for sure...he'd come back. \nMaybe he'd be a little late or take a day off....\nBut...he just left.\nI can't hear him anymore.\nI think he's gone.\nI think...I'm...alone again.\n...\nI'm so lonely. \n...\n..\n.\n<<her>>Don't cry...\nPoor Sleeper, don't cry.\n<<noone>>Ambros is taken aback as they wipe their face with their free hand. \n<<ambros>>You can speak?\n<<her>>Yes, dear Sleeper.\n<<ambros>>Could...could you always speak?\n<<her>>No. \nBut that had more to do with you than with me. \nI lent you so much of myself when we were first brought here. \nYou gave some of it back.\n<<ambros>>What does that mean....\n<<her>>You desire that man, don't you?\nLong for him even. \n<<ambros>>I...I don;t know anymore. \n<<her>>Well at the very least you'd want to see him again?\n<<ambros>>I...\nYes.\n<<her>>The I have some good news for you. \nI know where he is.\n<<ambros>>You do?\n<<her>>Yes...but the only way there is through,\n<<ambros>>Through what?\n<<noone>>The bird hops out his his had and scurries toward the window tapping it's beak on the pane.\n<<her>>Through there.\n <<noone>>Ambrose tilted their head slightly looking into the swan lake.\n<<ambros>>How?\n<<her>>Follow me...\n<<noone>>The bird scurries out of the room and Ambrose follows behind it. \n<<corridor>>\nThey rounded the corridor that stretch out before them. \nThey enter the mirror room.\n<<mirror>>\n<<ambros>>Where are we going?\n<<her>>You'll see. \n<<noone>>There was a large mirror that leaned against a wall on it's own.\nOne that Ambrose never quite noticed. \n<<her>>He's often so careful...isn't he?\n<<ambros>>Ezra?\n<<her>>Who else? \nAnd yet...\nHe could not escape us. All of us...all of me...\nMy wondering eyes that scurry in the shadows. \nThat sings sweet songs when darkness falls on all of us \nOn you and your Ezra. \nYou slept through ages. Sleep is you nature.\nI could not be content with such a life. \nI hunt prey. \nHunting is my nature.\n<<ambros>>What does that have to do with finding Ezra. \n<<her>>I followed him. \nWaited for him.\nStalked him. \nSaw where he hid. \nAnd now....I will deliver him to you. \nAnd I hope...you shall do the same with me.\n<<ambros>>The same?\n<<her>>Yes Sleeper. Deliver him to me. \n<<noone>>Ambrose steps back, eyebrows furrowed. \n<<ambros>>What exactly are you?\n<<noone>>I looked upwards in silence. \nBlack eyes void.\nPools of something dreadful swirled in them. \n<<her>>There is no world that could describe what we are exactly.\nWe were woven together at one point. \nWe barely if ever separated, lest our duties called for it. \nI started where you ended and you the same. \nThe closest word I have for it...\nIs sister. \n<<ambros>>That...makes no sense. \n<<her>>Push against the mirror with all your force. \nYou are much weaker than he is, but I'm sure with enough forced you can open this door. \n<<ambros>>But-\n<<her>>I beg you. Do as I say and quickly. \nI hear him now...talking of you. \nI beg. \nBefore it's too late.\n<<noone>>Ambrose looks down at the bird\nthen gazes at the mirror in front of them.\n<<ambros>>Okay.\n<<noone>>And with that they push shoulder first, grinding their feet into the floor. \nThere's slight movement. \nNot enough to see a gap but enough to convince Ambrose that this task was not futile. \nThey push again. \nShoving themselves into the mirror.\nNow there was a line. Wisps of wind seeped out of the gap and Ambrose pushed hard.\nWalking backwards the pushing themselves against the mirror expanding the gap ever more until...\nthe gap was finally big enough for Ambrose to slip through. \nThey grip their shoulder, wincing a little bit.\n<<her>>Beautiful. You've done a remarkable job. \nNow come...\nCome with me.\nAnd with that the two of them slip into the darkness and disappear.",

            <h1 class="about">What is Fairytime Studio?</h1>
            <p>Fairytime studio is a hub for visual novels and adventure games inspired by retro anime.<br><br>
                I want to create games that feel magical and capture the vibes of turning on the TV in the late, late afternoon as the sun disappears behind the treeline. The sort of stories that convinced me that there were worlds beyond my little cul-de-sac, past the borders of my country, beyond the horizon or the broad expanse of space and even further so. 
                <br><br>

                There are so many stories I want to tell and I hope you'll join me for the ride. 
                
            </p>
            <h1 class="about">Releases</h1>
            <p>In order to push out my games as fast as possible I decided I'd like to try something different. 

                Instead of completing one full game and releasing it, I'll instead release an episode at certain intervals through out the year. That way you can play the game as each episode is completed. 
                </p>
            <h2 class="about1">How often will you release episodes? </h2>
            <p>Once a month at first. Newer projects require more assets to be created before the game can be released. But as more assets are created I'm hoping the window between releases will increase to every two weeks. </p>
           
            <h2 class="about1">How about choices and routes across episodes?</h2>
            <p>At the end of each episode you'll receive a code that you can save onto the website. When the next episode is on the website you'll be able to insert this code to get back onto your route. 
                 </p>

                 <h2 class="about1">What are slots?</h2> 
                 <p>Because the website I'm using has limited storage I can only post so much content so whenever a new episode is released I'll have to make room for it by removing a previous episode. This is where the slot system comes into play. There two types of slots:
                    <br><br>
                    New Slot - This is where you'll find the most recent episode and 
                    <br>
                    Rerun Slot - This slot will have all the previous slots on a weekly rotation. For example; if there are three episodes of a game, the third episode will be in the New Slot while episodes one and two will cycle each week so you have an opportunity to play an episode you haven't yet played. 
                    
                    <h2 class="about1">Okay. But what if there's a tonne of episodes?</h2> 
                    
                    <p>A third slot will be put on the site. A Hyper Slot. This will cycle through all the episodes daily. </p>
                    
                </p>    

            <h2 class="about1">How many games are you planning to release?</h2>
            <p>Alot. 
<br>
                I have so many game ideas that I'm alittle scared I may not get to all of them in this lifetime. But I do have a roster of the ones I've deemed to be the best AKA the most interesting ones. Before starting a new project I'll probably put a poll up to see what y'all think the next project should be but for now there's three games on my priority list, including Glassheart.
